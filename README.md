## Getting Started

 Plugin collects specified metrics in-band on OS level.

### System Requirements

* Linux system with df command

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64

### Installation
#### Download df plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [Github Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-df

Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-df
```
Build the plugin by running make in repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs`

### Configuration and Usage

* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started).
* Load the plugin and create a task, see example in [Examples](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-df/blob/master/README.md#examples).

#### Docker 
* This plugin is not compatible with Docker as df will get metrics from the container instead of the host machine. 

## Documentation

### Collected Metrics

List of collected metrics is described in [METRICS.md](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-df/blob/master/METRICS.md).


### Examples

Example running snap-plugin-collector-df plugin and writing data to a file.

Make sure that your `$SNAP_PATH` is set, if not:
```
$ export SNAP_PATH=<snapDirectoryPath>/build
```
Other paths to files should be set according to your configuration, using a file you should indicate where it is located.

In one terminal window, open the snap daemon (in this case with logging set to 1,  trust disabled):
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapd -l 1 -t 0
```
In another terminal window:

Load snap-plugin-collector-df plugin:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load snap-plugin-collector-df
```
Load file plugin for publishing:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load $SNAP_PATH/plugin/snap-publisher-file
```
See available metrics:

```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl metric list
```

Create a task manifest file to use snap-plugin-collector-df plugin (exemplary file in [examples/task/] (https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-df/blob/master/examples/task/)):
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "schedule": {
        "type": "simple",
        "interval": "5s"
    },
    "workflow": {
        "collect": {
            "metrics": {
		        "/intel/procfs/filesystem/rootfs/space_free": {},
                "/intel/procfs/filesystem/rootfs/space_reserved": {},
                "/intel/procfs/filesystem/rootfs/inodes_percent_free": {},
                "/intel/procfs/filesystem/rootfs/inodes_percent_used": {},
                "/intel/procfs/filesystem/rootfs/device_name": {},
                "/intel/procfs/filesystem/sys_fs_cgroup/inodes_used": {}
           },
            "config": {
            },
            "process": null,
            "publish": [
                {
                    "plugin_name": "file",
                    "config": {
                        "file": "/tmp/published_df"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```
Create a task:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl task create -t df-file.json
```
